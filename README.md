## 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates the **usage of Java Collection Framework methods** through a single Java program:  
**`Collection_Methods.java`**.

The program focuses on **ArrayList**, one of the most widely used classes in Java, and shows how built-in **Collection methods** help in managing, modifying, and analyzing data efficiently.

This repository is ideal for:
- Java beginners
- Interview preparation
- Understanding real-world data handling using collections

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Learn Java **Collection Framework**
- Understand **ArrayList operations**
- Explore commonly used **Collection methods**
- Apply collections to real-life scenarios
- Strengthen Core Java fundamentals

---

## 🧠 Concepts Covered

### ✅ Java Collection Framework
The Collection Framework provides a **unified architecture** for storing and manipulating groups of objects.

Benefits:
- Reduces coding effort
- Improves performance
- Provides ready-made algorithms
- Increases code readability

---

### ✅ ArrayList
`ArrayList` is a **resizable array implementation** of the List interface.

Key characteristics:
- Maintains insertion order
- Allows duplicate elements
- Dynamic size
- Fast random access

---

### ✅ Collection Methods Used
Typical methods demonstrated include:
- `add()`
- `remove()`
- `contains()`
- `size()`
- `isEmpty()`
- `clear()`
- `addAll()`

## 🧩 File Description

### 🔹 `Collection_Methods.java`

This file demonstrates how **Collection interface methods** work with an **ArrayList**.

It includes operations such as:
- Adding elements to a collection
- Removing elements
- Checking element existence
- Finding size of collection
- Clearing all elements
- Performing bulk operations

---

## ▶️ How to Run the Program

1. Clone the repository:
`
git clone <repository-url>
`

2. Navigate to the project directory:
`
cd Java-Collection-Methods
`
3. Compile the program:
`
javac Collection_Methods.java
`

4. Run the program:
`
java Collection_Methods
`

## 🌍 Real-Life Application Example
## 🏦 Banking System Example

In a banking application:  
Customer transactions are stored in an ArrayList  
add() is used to add new transactions  
remove() deletes cancelled transactions  
contains() checks if a transaction exists  
size() gives total transaction count  
The same logic used in Collection_Methods.java applies directly to real banking software.

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

Add LinkedList and HashSet examples  
Include user input using Scanner  
Add sorting using Collections.sort()  
Implement Stream API methods  
Add comments explaining each method line-by-line
